# gnome-credential-helper is now deprecated.
# Use libsecret instaed.

# 1. Make sure libsecret and its development libraries are installed:
sudo apt install libsecret-1-0 libsecret-1-dev

# 2. Then build the credential helper from the sources shipped with libsecret's development libraries:
sudo make --directory=/usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret

# 3. Finally, register the freshly compiled binary as a Git credential helper:
git config --global credential.helper /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret/git-credential-libsecret
